In 1963, Edward Lorenz with the help from several other scientists, developed a simplified mathematical model for atmospherical convection, i.e. the three ordinary differential equations. Specifically, x is proportional to the rate of convection, y to the horizontal temperature variation, and z to the vertical temperature variaiton. The constant sigma is proportional to Prandtl number, rou is proportional to rayleigh number and beta refers to certain physical dimensions of the layer itself. Moreover the Lorenz system can arise in simplified models for lasers, dynamos, brushless DC motors, chemical reactions etc.
